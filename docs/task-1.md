Please follow the steps below to serve the model [Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct) using vLLM or sglang (GPU or CPU) and evaluate its performance on the [HumanEval](../datasets/humaneval/HumanEval.jsonl) task:

1. **Serving the Model with vLLM or SgLang**:
   - Utilize the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or [SgLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) to serve the model on the CPU or GPU.
   - Create a Python script to set up a Docker instance that serves the model. This will ensure the environment is consistent and portable.

2. **Inference**:
   - Develop a script to perform inference the HumanEval dataset.
   - This script should interact with the served model to generate predictions for the provided samples.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Use a sandbox environment(docker instance) to assess the pass rate of the HumanEval results obtained from the Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct model.
   - This evaluation will help determine the effectiveness of the model's predictions.

4. **Performance Improvement**
   - Consider enhancing the performance of the inference and evaluation processes.
