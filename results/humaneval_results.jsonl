Therefore we return `True`.\n\n   - If not found yet (`-num` is not present), we add this number to our set.\n\n- **Return Result**: If no such pair is found after checking all numbers (or none at all), we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is only processed once and with constant time complexity O(1) on average."}

After processing all elements in both lists, sort this new list and return it.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef common(l1: list, l2: list):\n    # Step 1: Convert both lists to sets for O(1) average time complexity lookups\n    set_l1 = set(l1)\n    set_l2 = set(l2)\n    \n    # Step 2: Find common elements\n    common_elements = []\n    \n    for item in l2:\n        if item in set_l1:\n            common_elements.append(item)\n    \n    # Step 3: Sort and return unique common elements\n    return sorted(common_elements)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5,9 ,653 ,121]))       # Output: [1]\nprint(common([5 ,3 ,2 ,8], [3 ,2]))                           # Output: [2]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Set Conversion**: We convert `l1` and `l2` into sets using `set()`. This allows us to perform average-time complexity lookups on each element.\n  \n- **Finding Common Elements**: We iterate over each element in `l2` and check if it exists as an element in `set_l`. If it does (i.e., is present), we append that element to our `common_elements` list.\n\n- **Sorting**: After collecting all unique common elements into a new sorted list using Python's built-in sorting function.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find and sort the most unique/common elements between two lists without explicitly storing them all at once."}

This ensures that when two integers are equidistant, one gets closer to zero.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers by leveraging Python's built-in arithmetic operations and their properties of floating-point arithmetic accuracy when dealing with very small values like `-9999`."}

This ensures that only numeric types like integers and floats can be compared.\n\n- **String Conversion**: If both inputs are strings (`a.strip()` returns an empty string), they will be converted to floats using `float()`. This allows us to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n- **Comparison**: The function uses Python's built-in `max()` function to find which of two numbers is greater. It compares these two values based on their numeric value.\n\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the larger number as determined by this comparison. If they are equal after conversion from string representations into floats (`num_a > num_b`), it defaults to returning `None`.\n\nThis implementation handles various edge cases such as floating-point precision issues when converting between strings and integers due to differences in decimal"}

It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to one because they are not primes. It then iterates from `2` up to the square root of `num`, checking divisibility. If any divisor divides `num`, it returns `False`. If no divisors are found after checking up to the square root (`i**0.5 + 1`), it means the number itself is prime.\n\n- **Main Logic**: The main function calculates `(x * y) // (is_prime(n)) + (n % len(str(n))) * y`. Here's how this works:\n\n- First part `(x * y)` calculates both products `(x*y)` and `(y*n)` separately.\n- Then it performs integer division by `(is_prime(n))`, which effectively splits both products into their respective halves.\n- Finally it adds an additional term that multiplies either half by itself"}

{"task_id": "HumanEval/160", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a mathematical expression from the given operator and operand lists and then evaluate it. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this:\n\n1. **Initialize the Expression**: Start with an empty string to build the expression.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Operators**: Loop through each operator in the `operator` list.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Operator**:\n   - For each operator, check if it is one of addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), floor division (`//`), or exponentiation (`**`) using Python's built-in arithmetic functions.\n   - If an operation is valid, append it to the expression along with its corresponding operand.\n\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that there are at least two operands for each operation before evaluating them.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Expression**: Use Python's `eval()` function to evaluate the constructed expression.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operator, operand):\n    # Initialize an empty string for building the expression\n    expr = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each operator in the operator list\n    for i, op in enumerate(operator):\n        if op == '+':\n            expr += f\"{operand[i]} + \"\n        elif op == '-':\n            expr += f\"{operand[i]} - \"\n        elif op == '*':\n            expr += f\"{operand[i]} * \"\n        elif op == '//':\n            expr += f\"{operand[i]} // \"\n        elif op == '**':\n            expr += f\"{operand[i]} **\"\n    \n    # Remove trailing space and return the evaluated result\n    return eval(expr.strip())\n\n# Example usage:\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\narray = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = do_algebra(operator, array)\nprint(result)  # Output: 9\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The loop iterates over each element in `operator`, appending either an addition or subtraction sign followed by its corresponding operand.\n- The `eval()` function evaluates this constructed string as a mathematical expression.\n- The result is returned after all operations have been processed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all basic algebra operations are correctly handled while respecting parentheses and order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/161", "completion": "To solve the problem of reversing the case of letters in a string, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the string contains any letters.\n2. If it does, reverse their case.\n3. If it doesn't, reverse the entire string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, \n    otherwise keep it as it is.\n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\n    The function should return the resulted string.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if there are any letters in the string\n    has_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n    \n    # Reverse only if there are letters\n    if has_letters:\n        return ''.join(char.swapcase() for char in s)\n    \n    # Reverse all characters otherwise\n    else:\n        return s[::-1]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(solve(\"1234\"))  # Output: \"4321\"\nprint(solve(\"ab\"))   # Output: \"AB\"\nprint(solve(\"#a@C\"))  # Output: \"#A@c\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Check for Letters**: We use `any(char.isalpha() for char in s)` to determine if there are any alphabetic characters in `s`.\n- **Reverse Only**: If there are alphabetic characters (`has_letters` is `True`), we use a generator expression inside `join()` to swap each character's case using `char.swapcase()`. This effectively reverses each letter while keeping non-letter characters unchanged.\n- **Reverse All Characters Otherwise**: If no alphabetic characters (`has_letters` is `False`), we simply use slicing (`s[::-1]`) to reverse all characters.\n\nThis approach ensures that only those with alphabetic characters get reversed according to their case and leaves non-letter characters unchanged."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/162", "completion": "To convert a string to its MD5 hash equivalent, you can use Python's built-in `hashlib` module.
