For each element at index `i`, it compares it with its successor at index `i + 1`.\n- If any pair of consecutive elements does not satisfy one direction (increasing or decreasing), it returns `False`.\n- If all pairs satisfy one direction (increasing or decreasing), it returns `True`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for monotonicity by leveraging simple comparisons and iterating through only necessary pairs."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Identify the Common Elements**: We need to find elements that are present in both lists and are also unique.\n\n2. **Sort and Remove Duplicates**: Once we have the common elements, we need to sort them and remove duplicates.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the sorted list of unique common elements.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef common(l1: list, l2: list):\n    # Step 1: Find common elements\n    intersection = set(l1) & set(l2)\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort and remove duplicates\n    sorted_unique_common_elements = sorted(list(intersection))\n    \n    return sorted_unique_common_elements\n\n# Test cases\nprint(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5,9 ,653 ,121]))       # Output: [1]\nprint(common([5 ,3 ,2 ,8], [3 ,2]))                   # Output: [2]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Set Intersection**: We use set operations `&` to find all elements that are present in both `l1` and `l2`. This gives us a set of unique common elements.\n  \n- **Sorting and Removing Duplicates**: We convert the intersection set back into a list using `list()` before sorting it with `sorted()`. This ensures that duplicate values are removed from the output.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds and returns the required result by leveraging Python's built-in data structures for sets (which inherently handle uniqueness)."}

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this in Python:\n\n1. **Check for divisibility by 2**: If `n` is divisible by 2, then it must be a prime number itself. The largest prime factor of 2 is 2.\n\n2. **Check for odd factors**: If `n` is not divisible by 2, then it must be divisible by some odd number greater than or equal to 3. We can start checking from the smallest odd numbers: 3, 5, etc.\n\n3. **Divide out all factors**: Once we have found an odd factor that divides `n`, divide it out and continue checking the next possible factors.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:\n    if n <= 1:\n        return None\n    \n    # Check divisibility by smallest even number\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        n //= 2\n    \n    # Check for odd factors starting from i = i + i (i.e., i = i + j)\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) +1, 2):\n        while n % i ==0:\n            n //= i\n    \n    # If after all checks no factor was found (which shouldn't happen since we started with even numbers), return the original number\n    if n > 1:\n        return n\n    \n    return None\n\n# Test cases\nprint(largest_prime_factor(13195))   # Output: \nprint(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: \n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initial Check**: We first check if `n` is less than or equal to one, which means there are no prime factors.\n- **Even Factorization**: We start dividing `n` by both its smallest even divisor (which is always even). This ensures that any remaining divisors are also potential primes.\n- **Odd Factorization**: After finding an even divisor (`i = j`), we iterate through potential odd divisors starting from `j`.

The recursive call returns:\n  \n   \\[\n   \\text{sum\\_to\\_9} = \\text{sum\\_to\\_8} + n = (39 + n) - (28 + n) = (39 - 28) + n - (28 + n)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this expression:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{sum\\_to\\_9} = (11) + n - (-4)\n   \\]\n\n     Since `-4` is equivalent to adding an additional `-4` in Python, we get:\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{sum\\_to\\_9} = 5 + n\n     ```\n\n- For `n = 5`, since it's greater than or equal to both values, we call itself with `n-1`.\n\n\\[\n\\text{sum_to_6} = (\\text{sum_to_5}) + ((5+6)+7+8+...+(6+5))\n\\]\n\nSince there are no more numbers in this sequence, we add these terms together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sum_to_6} = ((5+6)+7)+((8+7)+...+(6+5)) \n= ((7)+(8)+(...)+(6)) \n= (((7*4)/2)) \n= (((3*2)/2)) \n= ((3*1)/2)\n= ((3/2)*((3/4)))\n      \u2248((\\frac{(3^3)}{(4^x)})*(x))\n      \u2248((\\frac{(e^(-x)-e^{-(-x)})(e^{(-x)}*(e^{-(x)})}{(e^(-(-x)))*(e^{-(-x)}}))\n            \u2248((\\frac{-"}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/61", "completion": "To solve the problem of checking if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string, we can use a stack data structure.

When we encounter an opening bracket `(`, we push it onto the list.\n\n2. **Matching Closing Brackets**: As we iterate through each character:\n   - If it's an open parenthesis `(`, we simply append it to `stack`.\n   - If it's a close parenthesis `)`, we check two conditions:\n     - The list is empty (`not stack`), which means there are no unmatched parentheses.\n     - The current character doesn't match `(`, so this indicates that there are unmatched parentheses.\n     - Otherwise, pop from `stack`.\n\n3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, if `stack` is empty (`len(stack)`), all parentheses were matched correctly; otherwise, they were not.\n\nThis approach ensures that every pair of matching pairs exists in order within the string."}

This approach reduces unnecessary checks by checking only necessary factors (up to half of the string's length).\n- If any divisor divides evenly into `len(string)` (i.e., there exists at least one integer between `i` and `len(str)` that divides both), it returns `False`.\n- If no divisors are found after checking all possibilities, it returns `True`, indicating that all characters in the string have an even frequency.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines whether a given string has an odd number of characters and thus concludes as \"prime\" based on its character frequency distribution."}

The `[2:]` slice removes these two characters from both ends since we only want numeric characters (digits).\n  \n- **Removing Leading 'b'**: We use slicing (`[::2]`) with `base=2` to extract every other character from each byte position (i.e., every second bit). This effectively separates each digit into two parts.\n\n- **Summing Digits**: We convert these two-digit strings back into integers using `int(...[::2], base=2)` and add them together.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly handle both positive integers and those with leading zeros by correctly removing them before processing them further."}

Compare the values and return the appropriate type.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef compare_one(a, b):\n    # Try converting both inputs to float\n    try:\n        # Convert a string to float if it represents a number with a comma or dot as decimal separator\n        num_a = float(a)\n        num_b = float(b)\n    except ValueError:\n        # If conversion fails (e.g., non-numeric string), convert it to an integer if possible\n        try:\n            num_a = int(a)\n            num_b = int(b)\n        except ValueError:\n            return None\n\n    # Compare the numbers and return their respective type\n    if num_a > num_b:\n        return \"a\"\n    elif num_a < num_b:\n        return \"b\"\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Test cases\nprint(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # \u279e 2.5\nprint(compare_one(1, \"2,3\"))   # \u279e \"2,3\"\nprint(compare_one(\"5,1\", \"6\"))   # \u279e \"6\"\nprint(compare_one(\"1\", 1))      # \u279e None\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Try-Catch for Strings**: The function first tries to convert `a` and `b` into floating-point numbers using `float()`. If either conversion fails (e.g., due to non-numeric characters), it catches this exception and attempts to convert them back into integers using `int()`.\n\n- **Comparison**: After attempting conversions (`try-catch`), it compares the two numbers. It returns `\"a\"` if `num_a` is greater than `num_b`, `\"b\"` if less than `num_b`, or `\"None\"` if they are equal.\n\nThis approach ensures that even when dealing with mixed data types in Python dictionaries or lists of mixed types like tuples or sets of mixed values represented as strings without commas or periods as decimal separators."}

If we take half of the largest possible value for one term (which would make it an odd number), then this would result in a total that cannot be expressed as a sum of four positive evens.\n- Therefore, any integer greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) cannot be expressed as such a sum.\n\nGiven these observations, let's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\"\"\"\n    # Check if n >= 9/4\n    if n >= (9 / 4):\n        return False\n    \n    # If not greater than or equal to this threshold, it's impossible to express n as such\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))   # Output: False\nprint(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))   # Output: True\n```\n\nThis function checks if `n` meets or exceeds \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).

{"task_id": "HumanEval/161", "completion": "To solve the problem of reversing the case of letters in a string or keeping non-letter characters unchanged, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the string contains any letters.\n2. If it does, reverse the case of each letter.\n3. If it doesn't contain any letters, reverse the entire string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve(s):\n    # Check if there are any letters in the string\n    contains_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n    \n    # Reverse case for letters and keep non-letter characters unchanged\n    if contains_letters:\n        return ''.join(char.swapcase() if char.isalpha() else char for char in s)\n    else:\n        return s[::-1]\n\n# Examples\nprint(solve(\"1234\"))  # Output: \"4321\"\nprint(solve(\"ab\"))   # Output: \"AB\"\nprint(solve(\"#a@C\"))  # Output: \"#A@c\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Checking Letters**: We use a generator expression within `any()` to check if there are any alphabetic characters (`char.isalpha()`).\n- **Reversing Case**: For each character that is an alphabet (checked using `char.isalpha()`), we use `swapcase()` to swap its case (`char.swapcase()`). Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.\n- **Handling Non-Letters**: If no alphabetic characters are found, we simply reverse the entire string using slicing (`s[::-1]`).\n\nThis function efficiently handles both cases and provides correct results based on whether there are any alphabetic characters in the input string."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/162", "completion": "To convert a string to its MD5 hash equivalent string, you can use the `hashlib` library in Python. The `hashlib.md5()` function generates an MD5 hash of the input text. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.\n    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.\n\n    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n    \"\"\"\n    if not text:\n        return None\n    \n    # Create an md5 hash object\n    md = hashlib.md5()\n    \n    # Update the hash object with the bytes of the text\n    md.update(text.encode('utf-8'))\n    \n    # Return the hexadecimal representation of the digest\n    return md.hexdigest()\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(string_to_md5('Hello world'))  # Output: 3e2...\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing `hashlib`:** This library provides functions to work with various hashing algorithms.\n\n2. **Function Definition:** The function `string_to_md5` takes a single argument, which is the input string.\n\n3. **Empty String Check:** Before generating any hashes, check if the input text is empty using `if not text:` and return `None` if it is.\n\n4. **MD Hash Initialization:** Use `hashlib.md5()` to create a new MDHash object.\n\n   - `.update(text.encode('utf-8'))`: This updates the hash object with each byte in the UTF-8 encoded version of `'text'`.\n\n   - `.hexdigest()`: This returns a hexadecimal representation of all bytes in the digest as a lowercase hexadecimal number (e.g., `'3e'`).\n\nThis approach ensures that only valid characters are considered when generating an MDHash and handles edge cases like empty strings gracefully by returning `None`."}
