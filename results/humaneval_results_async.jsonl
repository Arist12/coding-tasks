A sentence is considered bored if it starts with \"I\" and contains at least one non-space character. Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n   \n    For example:\n    >>> is_bored(\"Hello world\")\n    0\n    >>> is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\")\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Split the string into sentences based on '.', '?', or '!'\n    \n    sentences = S.split('.')\n    \n   # Initialize a counter for boredoms\n    \n   boredom_count = 0\n    \n   # Iterate over each sentence in the list\n    \n   for sentence in sentences:\n       # Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence\n        \n       trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip()\n       \n       # Check if the trimmed_sentence starts with 'I' and contains at least one non-space character\n        \n       if trimmed_sentence.startswith('I') and len(trimmed_sentence) > 0:\n           boredom_count += 1\n    \n   return boredom_count\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_bored(\"Hello world\"))        # Output: 0\nprint(is_bored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\"))     # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Splitting Sentences**: We use `split('.')` to divide the input string into individual sentences based on '.', '?' or '!'.\n\n2. **Trimming Sentences**: For each sentence, we strip any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`.\n\n3. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - If a trimmed sentence starts with 'I' (case-insensitive).\n   - It must contain at least one non-space character.\n\n4. **Counting Boredoms**: We maintain a counter `boring_count` to keep track of how many such sentences exist.\n\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the total count of boredoms found.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts all such boringom-like sentences in O(n) time complexity due to splitting and stripping operations, where n is the length of the input string after splitting it by periods (or other delimiters).", "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    # Check some simple cases\n    assert candidate(\"Hello world\") == 0, \"Test 1\"\n    assert candidate(\"Is the sky blue?\") == 0, \"Test 2\"\n    assert candidate(\"I love It !\") == 1, \"Test 3\"\n    assert candidate(\"bIt\") == 0, \"Test 4\"\n    assert candidate(\"I feel good today.

A string is considered balanced if every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and they are properly nested.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Count Parentheses**: First, count the number of opening parentheses '(' and closing parentheses ')'. This will help us determine how many times we can concatenate them in different orders.\n\n2. **Check Balance**: For each possible concatenation of two strings:\n   - Concatenate them in both possible orders.\n   - Check if either concatenated string results in a balanced string.\n\n3. **Return Result**: If at least one concatenated string results in a balanced string, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    def is_balanced(s):\n        balance = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char == '(':\n                balance += 1\n            elif char == ')':\n                balance -= 1\n            # If balance goes negative, it means there are more closing than opening ones\n            if balance < 0:\n                return False\n        return balance == 0\n\n    # Count open and close parentheses for both strings\n    open_count = lst[0].count('(')\n    close_count = lst[1].count(')')\n    \n    # Possible concatenations: (())() or ()()\n    possibilities = [\n        (lst[0] + lst[1], lst[0] + lst[1]),  # Both concatenations are good by default\n    \n        (lst[:2], lst),               # Concatenating at index [0]\n        \n        (lst[:3], lst[:2]),          # Concatenating at index [3]\n        \n        (lst[-3:], lst[-4:])       # Concatenating at index [-4]\n        \n        (lst[:-3], lst[:-4])       # Concatenating at index [-3]\n        \n        (lst[:-2], lst)               # Concatenating at index [-2]\n        \n        (lst[:-3], lst)               # Concatenating at index [-3]\n        \n         ('', '')                  // An empty pair of strings results in an empty result\n        \n         ('(', ')')                 // Single character pairs result in single character results\n        \n         ('()', '(())')             // Pairing with itself", "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    # Check some simple cases\n    assert candidate(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    assert candidate([')', ')']) == 'No'\n    assert candidate(['(()(())', '())())']) == 'No'\n    assert candidate([')())', '(()()(']) == 'Yes'\n    assert candidate(['(())))', '(()())((']) == 'Yes'\n    assert candidate(['()', '())']) == 'No'\n    assert candidate(['(()(', '()))()']) == 'Yes'\n    assert candidate(['((((', '((())']) == 'No'\n    assert candidate([')(()', '(()(']) == 'No'\n    assert candidate([')(', ')(']) == 'No'\n    \n\n    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.\n    assert candidate(['(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n    assert candidate([')', '(']) == 'Yes' \n\n", "entry_point": "match_parens"}

Then, for each triple `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k`, the sum of these elements must be divisible by 3. We will count how many such triples exist.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Generate the array `a` by squaring integers from 1 to n.\n2. Iterate through all possible triples `(i, j, k)` with `i < j < k`.\n3. Check if the sum of these elements is divisible by 3.\n4. Count how many such triples exist.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_max_triples(n):\n    # Generate the array a\n    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize count of valid triples\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible triples (i, j, k)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0:\n                    count += 1\n    \n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 5\nprint(get_max_triples(n))  # Output: Output should be one since only one valid triple (2^2 - (-2) + (-2) = -8) is divisible by both multiples of three and has three elements total.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Array Generation**: We use list comprehension to create the array `a` where each element is \\(i^2 - i + \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n- **Triple Iteration**: We iterate over all possible triplets \\((i, j, k)\\) using nested loops that ensures \\(j > i > k\\).\n- **Sum Check**: For each triplet \\((a[i], a[j], a[k])\\), we check if their sum is divisible by \\(6\\) (since \\(6 = \\frac{9}{5}\\)).\n- **Counting Valid Triples**: If the condition is met, we increment our counter.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the number of valid triples using combinatorial mathematics and list comprehensions.", "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    assert candidate(5) == 1\n    assert candidate(6) == 4\n    assert candidate(10) == 36\n    assert candidate(100) == 53361\n", "entry_point": "get_max_triples"}
