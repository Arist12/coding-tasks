The extra characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string are used to help with formatting. Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(decimal):\n    # Convert the decimal number to binary using Python's built-in function\n    binary_representation = bin(decimal)[2:]  # [2:] removes the '0b' prefix\n    \n    # Format the binary representation with extra characters 'db'\n    formatted_representation = f\"db{binary_representation}db\"\n    \n    return formatted_representation\n\n# Test cases\nprint(decimal_to_binary(15))   # Output: \"db1111db\"\nprint(decimal_to_binary(32))   # Output: \"db100000db\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Binary Conversion**: We use Python's built-in `bin()` function, which converts a decimal number to its binary representation as a string prefixed with `'0b'`. The `[2:]` slice removes these two leading zeros.\n\n2. **Formatting**: We format the binary string by adding two additional characters `'db'` before and after it.\n\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the formatted string containing both hexadecimal and hexadecimal representations of the input decimal number.\n\nThis approach ensures that each character in the resulting string is either '0' or '1', adhering to your requirements for formatting.", "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    # Check some simple cases\n    assert candidate(0) == \"db0db\"\n    assert candidate(32) == \"db100000db\"\n    assert candidate(103) == \"db1100111db\"\n    assert candidate(15) == \"db1111db\", \"This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)\"\n\n    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.\n    assert True, \"This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)\"\n\n", "entry_point": "decimal_to_binary"}
